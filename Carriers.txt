We had this limitation where our ships were distinguished by TYPE only. This created a problem where you could not use the same ship twice side by side.  This is fixed now:
In order to have both Dynamic Super Carrier and Static Super Carrier side by side, we need to check in the code which Carrier is being killed.  Is it the one from the warehouse, or is it the one from the miz file.  In case we killed
the dynamic ship, then we respawn him in the naval warehouse.  If we killed the ship that is part of the mission, then nothing happens.  We do not respawn him.  The way this is done is by a new function where we check for carrier type 
(CV_1143_5) and then we check for naval warehouse carrier name: "Resupply".  If the name of the unit has "Resupply" in it, it came from the warehouse.  That's when and only when we run the Naval Warehouse Respawn logic. Problem solved.
